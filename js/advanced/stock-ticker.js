//I have an array of 24 stock prices for each hour tomorrow,
// e.g. [20, 15, 1, 10, 15, 8, 16, 17, 8, 13, 10, 11, 19, 7, 6, 12, 6, 6, 6, 2, 11, 5, 1, 5].
//I start with no stock and can only buy and sell once, otherwise the time police will get me.
// Write a function that lets me know which hour to buy and which hour to sell to maximize my profit.

//For the above array, your function should return [2,12]
